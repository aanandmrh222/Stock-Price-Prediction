## Stock Price Prediction

A machine learning project in which the model was trained using LSTM layers and Reliance Stock prices were predicted and compared with thier actual values.

## About the Project:

A correct prediction of stocks can lead to huge profits for the seller and the broker. Frequently, it is brought out that prediction is chaotic rather than random, 
which means it can be predicted by carefully analyzing the history of respective stock market. 
Machine learning is an efficient way to represent such processes. It predicts a market value close to the tangible value, thereby increasing the accuracy. 
Introduction of machine learning to the area of stock prediction has appealed to many researches because of its efficient and accurate measurements. 
The vital part of machine learning is the dataset used. The dataset should be as concrete as possible because a little change in the data can perpetuate massive changes in the outcome. 
In this project, supervised machine learning is employed on a dataset obtained from Reliance data set from kaggle. 
This dataset comprises of the following variables: Date,Open,High,Low,Last,Close,Volume,Turnover. Open, close, low and high are different bid prices for the stock at separate times with nearly direct names. 
The model is then tested on the test data. Regression and LSTM models are engaged for this conjecture separately. Regression involves minimizing error and LSTM contributes to remembering the data and results for the long run. 
Finally, the graphs for the fluctuation of prices with the dates (in case of Regression based model) and between actual and predicted price (for the LSTM based model) are plotted.

## Future Scope:

Future scope of this project will involve adding more parameters and factors like the financial ratios, multiple instances, etc. 
The more the parameters are taken into account more will be the accuracy. The algorithms can also be applied for analyzing the contents
of public comments and thus determine patterns/relationships between the customer and the corporate employee. 
The use of traditional algorithms and data mining techniques can also help predict the corporation‟s performance structure as a whole.
